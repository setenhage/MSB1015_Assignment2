## MSB1015_Assignment2
Welcome to the repository of MSB1015 Assignment 2! Here I keep track of my progress of MSB1015 2019 Assignment 2 at Maastricht University.

## Project Description
Chemical properties, such as the boiling point, can be derived from the structure of a chemical compound. In 1947 Harry Wiener already made a corelation model to link structural features to boiling points.<sup>1</sup> The idea to use mathematical models to predict chemical properties from compound structures has been expaneded since then. In this project I will be using SPARQL to obtain chemical properties, such as the boiling points, of simple alkanes from WikiData and then train a Partial Least Squares model to predict these properties from the structure of the compounds. The results will be presented in a scatterplot.
